Baseline Comparison Analysis
============================================================

Our system performance:
  Recall@10: 40.0%

Baseline comparisons:
  vs random: 3.3% baseline, +1100% improvement
  vs popularity: 2.0% baseline, +1900% improvement
  vs bm25: 20.0% baseline, +100% improvement

Conclusions:
- Neural system significantly outperforms simple baselines
- Worth the added complexity
- BM25 is reasonable baseline but neural methods clearly better
